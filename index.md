# TCC - Turing Computer Club

Here's the TCC (Turing Computer Club) at Wenzhou-Kean University.

### Projects

Now we have 7 projects in total. They are:

#### H5 Game: Con-way

An interesting mini game. It looks easy but you can't complete the challenge easily. Clear the self increasing cubes on your screen with your spaceship and it's also a "game of life" with one player. It's still developing.

#### WKU Assistant (with WKU Navigator)

Now we are maintaining WKU Assistant. We are planning to update all old data and re-design the layout to help user to use. We want to merge the most functions that a WKU student will use.

#### MCU/Raspberry Pi Remote Car

A model of a car. We will design it since its circuit and structure. It will be able to transfer audio and video signals and can operate objects correctly. You can control it remotely or let it work by itself. It's still developing.

#### Cesno / Ceslang (With some students outside campus)

We are creating a language. We will make it as precise, customizable and powerful as we can. To make it powerful, we will make it a compiled language and allow running by interpreting. To make it customizable, we allow you to customize your own style. To make it precise, we are designing a new grammar and a unique set of keywords.

#### Minecraft Mod / Plugin Development

#### ACM/ICPC

#### Japanese Katakana Characterization Project (電算用語漢字化計画):

It is known that many terminologies related to Computer Science is translated into Katakana by transliteration. However, there is still many terminologies using Kanji. Kanji can be more "meaningful" than Katakana, because characters has it own meaning, but Katakana represents only the articulation. Also, we found that if all terminologies are represented in Kanji can increase the readability. Our group is planning to do the characterization (re-translate terminologies by using Kanji, 漢字化) of the Katakana terminologies in Japanese.
